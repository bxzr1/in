This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

## Project Description

An application to interact with different APIs to display current weather, background iamge, and an inspirational quote. It also provides users with a space to write down their goals for the day. Something like a fancy to-do list with dynamic data.
